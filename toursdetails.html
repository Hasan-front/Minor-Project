<h3>ABOUT THE DESTINATION:</h3>

Today is Jim Corbett’s 142nd birth anniversary. Few people to have walked this planet have done for wildlife what Jim Corbett has. A hunter-turned-conservationist, Jim Corbett was born in the year 1875 in Nainital, where his father was appointed as a postmaster. When Jim grew up, he held the rank of colonel in the British Army and gained recognition as an on-call hunter to kill man-eating tigers and leopards who were known to notoriously prey on people in villages of the Garhwal region. He then became an avid wildlife photographer and started spreading awareness about the need to preserve wildlife in India. Thanks to his efforts, a national reserve was established to protect the endangered Bengal tiger and it was named Hailey National Park. Following Jim Corbett’s demise in 1955, the Park was renamed Corbett National Park in 1957 to honor the great man. Today, the Jim Corbett National Park is one of India’s finest wildlife destinations.
